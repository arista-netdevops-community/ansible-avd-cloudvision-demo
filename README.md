# Arista Validated Design with CloudVision deployment

## About

This example implement a basic __EVPN/VXLAN Fabric__ based on __[Arista Validated Design roles](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd)__ with one layer of 2 spines and one layer of leafs (4 devices) using MLAG. Configuration deployment is not managed by eos EAPI, but through Arista CloudVision based on __[arista.cvp collection](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-cvp/)__

It helps to demonstrate how to bring up an Arista EVPN/VXLAN Fabric from the first boot.
